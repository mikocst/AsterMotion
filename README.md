# AsterMotion
React / Tailwind Animated Component Library 
- using Astro, React, Typescript, Tailwind CSS
- designed in Figma by Miko

- Users can copy paste code snippets, get the general structure of how UI components are created, and understand the use cases of each component.
I also go in depth on choosing a tech stack depending on what you're trying to create and where the inspiration for this project comes from. There
is also a section in the docs for mapping out goals and project based learning. 

- In the age of AI, there should be an effort to understand to why you design the way you do and how it is properly implemented in code. I think that
the understanding is valuable and it can only take you 80% of the way there. I feel that we're in a golden age where anyone can create but with these
super powers comes responsibility. 

- For v1 of this project, I'm creating a base UI library consisting of the Figma design file and the following components:
    - Accordion
    - Badges
    - Breadcrumb
    - Cards
    - Carousel
    - Code Block
    - File Uploader
    - Floating Action Button
    - Form
    - Input Field
    - Loading Bar
    - Pagination
    - Radio Input
    - Slider
    - Tabs
    - Switch
    - Toast
    - Tool Tip
